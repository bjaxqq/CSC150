# CSC150

## Course Description

This course provides a broad exposure to artificial intelligence, including its history and current usage. Students will learn about the growth of artificial intelligence from the early days of computing up to the current state-of-the-art systems that they interact with daily, sometimes without even realizing it. Case studies will be used to consider how AI systems are used in a variety of disciplines. Some programming is required so that students can explore the AI algorithms in sufficient detail.
